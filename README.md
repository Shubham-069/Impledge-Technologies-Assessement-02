Exercise 1: Automation
Automating Package Management – The automation script logs into KloudShip, navigates to "Package Types," adds a package with random dimensions, verifies its existence, and then deletes it in the second test.
Tool & Language Flexibility – The automation can be implemented using Java, JavaScript, or Python with tools like Selenium, Protractor, or Cypress.io while avoiding record-and-play methods.

Exercise 2: Postman
Fixing & Enhancing API Tests – The imported Postman collection is modified by renaming it, fixing failing test cases, and adding a new request to fetch shipment details.
Verification of API Response – Custom test cases validate that the retail_rate is equal to 12 and greater than list_rate in the shipment response.

Exercise 3: SQL
Executing Data Updates & Queries – SQL queries update Admissions table entries before retrieving relevant details about doctors, patients, and missing doctor assignments.
Retrieving Doctor & Patient Information – Queries fetch doctors with and without admissions and patients whose admissions are incomplete due to missing doctor details.
